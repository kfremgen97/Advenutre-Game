"""
You'll sometimes see variables in Python that have double underscores in the name, such as __name__ and __main__. 
These are also sometimes called "dunder" variablesâ€”with "dunder" being short for "double underscore".

Notice that these names have double underscores at both the beginning and the end.
When you see this, it's a signal that it's a special name that is reserved for use by Python. 

Although you don't always see it in the code, every script has its own copy of the __name__ variable. 
Before running the code in a program, Python assigns a value to this variable. 
The value it assigns depends on whether the script is being imported or getting directly executed.

If we directly run my_script.py, then __name__ gets set to '__main__'.
If we import my_script,py, then __name__ gets set to 'my_script'.

When you import a module, the code in that module gets run.
To avoid code from running upon import, we can wrap the code in an if block testing the __name__ variable
If __name__ is __main__, the script is ran directly so we can execute the code
"""
if '__name__' == '__main__':
